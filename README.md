# Ramu: Multilingual Speech-to-Text and AI Assistant (.NET MAUI)

## Overview
Ramu is a cross-platform .NET MAUI application that allows users to record speech in multiple languages, transcribe it using Azure Speech-to-Text, and interact with an AI assistant (powered by Azure OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo). The app supports English, Hindi, Bengali, and Spanish, and dynamically updates the UI based on the selected language.
